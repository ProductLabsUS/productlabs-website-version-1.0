<h1>Professional Services Agreement</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date: Jan 1st, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
This Professional Services Agreement (“PSA”) is entered into by and between Productlabs Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Productlabs" or “Provider”) and the person or entity placing an order for or accessing the Service (“Customer” or “you”). This PSA is entered into pursuant to the Terms of Service unless Customer has a written Productlabs master services agreement in which case such written Productlabs master services agreement will govern (in either case, the "Agreement"). All capitalized terms herein shall have the same definitions as set forth in the Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this PSA and the Agreement (as defined below) the terms of this PSA will control. In consideration of the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:
</p>

<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this PSA, Productlabs will provide Customer with Professional Services (as defined below) as set forth in the applicable statements of work executed by Productlabs and Customer (each, a “Statement of Work” or “SOW”). From time to time, the parties may enter into SOWs that specify the general consulting, implementation and/or training services to be provided to Customer hereunder (the “Professional Services”). All Statements of Work shall be deemed part of and subject to this PSA.
</p>

<p>
Subject to terms and conditions of this PSA and the Agreement, and during Customer’s Subscription Term, Productlabs hereby provides Customer with the non-exclusive, worldwide, limited right to use any deliverables and/or training materials delivered by Productlabs to Customer as part of the Professional Services (“Deliverables”) solely for Customer’s internal business operations including in connection with its authorized use of the applicable Service.

Within five (5) business days of receipt of the written notice, each party’s project leads shall meet to discuss the proposed changes. Productlabs will prepare a change order describing the proposed changes to the Statement of Work and the applicable change in Fees and expenses, if any (each, a “Change Order”). Change Orders are not binding unless and until they are executed by both parties. Executed Change Orders shall be deemed part of, and subject to, this PSA.
