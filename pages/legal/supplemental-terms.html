          <p>

            <h1>Productlabs Supplemental Terms</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date Jan 1, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
These Supplemental Terms (“Supplemental Terms”) apply to specific Services or aspects of Services as described herein and supplement and form a part of the Productlabs Terms of Service found at https://www.Productlabs.us/legal/terms/ unless Customer has a written Productlabs master services agreement executed between Customer and Productlabs Inc. for the Services, in which case these Supplemental Terms will supplement and form a part such written Productlabs master services agreement (in either case, the “Agreement”).
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Productlabs reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to update the Supplemental Terms in relation to the development of new or updates to existing features and functionality or Applicable Law. Customer’s continued usage of the Services may be relied upon by Productlabs as Customer’s acceptance of the then-current version of these Supplemental Terms. Sections entitled Beta and Free Services, Data Deletion, and AI-Powered Features will survive any termination of the Agreement.
</p>

<h2>Beta and Free Services</h2>

<p>
Productlabs may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services during a testing and evaluation period (“Beta Services”) or on a non-trial, free basis (together, “Free Services”). Because Beta Services can be at various stages of development, operation and use of the Beta Services may be unpredictable. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Beta Services have not been fully tested;</li>
    <li>Customer’s use of Beta Services will be for purposes of evaluating and testing new functionality and providing Feedback to Productlabs;</li>
    <li>Productlabs has no obligation to Customer to (i) further develop or release the Free Services or (ii) provide support for the Free Services;</li>
    <li>Customer bears the sole risk of using the Free Services;</li>
    <li>Productlabs provides the Free Services to Customer “as-is” and gives no representation, warranty, indemnity, or guarantee of any kind;</li>
    <li>Section 11 (Indemnification) does not apply to any Customer only using Free Services and the liability of any such Customer under the Agreement is not limited in any way;</li>
    <li>Productlabs has the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Services; and</li>
    <li>Productlabs reserves the rights to (i) fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Free Services with or without notice to Customer and (ii) make any given Free Services’ continued availability subject to a Fee at any time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Productlabs’ total aggregate liability and that of its suppliers relating to Beta Services is expressly limited to 100 USD for any and all damages regardless of the nature of the claim or theory of liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (3)(ii), 4, and 6 do not apply to Beta Services that have an associated Fee; provided, however, that Productlabs will provide a prorated refund for any such Fees paid in advance corresponding to the unused portion thereof in connection with any Beta Services cancellation.
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>

<p>
If Customer wishes to permanently delete Customer Data before the Data Export Period, contact support@Productlabs.us.
</p>

<h2>Short Message Services (“SMS”) and Multimedia Messaging Services (“MMS”) (together “Texting Services”) and Voice Communications</h2>

<p>
Certain Services facilitate the transmission and/or receipt of SMS, MMS, and voice communications (collectively, “Communication Services”). Customer acknowledges and agrees that Communication Services are provided by way of interfaces with services provided by Twilio Inc. or any of its affiliates (“Twilio”). Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer’s use of Communication Services is, in addition to being subject to this Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions imposed by Twilio relating to its provision of Communications Services and related functionalities, including, without limitation, those set forth at:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/messaging-policy">https://www.twilio.com/legal/messaging-policy</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/aup">https://www.twilio.com/legal/aup</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/guidelines/sms">https://www.twilio.com/guidelines/sms</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/service-country-specific-terms">https://www.twilio.com/legal/service-country-specific-terms</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy">https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy</a>; and</li>
    <li>any restrictions on use described in Twilio’s documentation at <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us">https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us</a> (e.g., Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada);</li>
</ul>

<p>
in each case as same may be updated from time to time (collectively, “Twilio Terms”).
</p>

<p>
Customer agrees to (i) comply with the Twilio Terms and any applicable law or regulation relating to the Communications Services including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws and laws and regulations related to telemarketing, robocalling, call spoofing, and spam, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Do Not Call Implementation Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, and CAN-SPAM Act and associated regulations, (ii) attain any necessary prior consent from any individuals or businesses with whom Customer communicates via the Communication Services, (iii) provide Productlabs with a validated street address as the registered place of use for each telephone number associated with the Communications Service, including any additional information such as suite, office number, building number or similar information necessary to adequately identify the location of the user (“Registered Location”), and to notify Productlabs in writing at least one week prior to changing such Registered Location, and (iv) indemnify, defend, and hold Productlabs and its Affiliates harmless from and against any costs related to third-party claims or regulatory actions arising from any of the foregoing or from any person’s use or attempted use of the Communications Services in accordance with the terms of Section 11 of the Productlabs Terms of Service. Customer further agrees that notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or these Supplemental Terms, Productlabs and its Affiliates have no liability for any (1) service unavailability or failure of the Communications Services or the efficacy of emergency communications except to provide a credit for any payments made by Customer for a period in which the Communications Services were not available solely due to the fault of Productlabs or its suppliers, or (2) for any damage, liabilities, losses, or any other consequences caused by Customer’s failure to maintain correct Registered Location information or to inform all potential users of the limitations of the Communications Services.
</p>

<p>
Customer agrees to cooperate with Productlabs and with requests Twilio makes of Productlabs to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that the Communication Services are being deployed in accordance with applicable law and regulations. If Twilio reports to Productlabs that Customer is allegedly violating the Twilio Terms, Productlabs will provide notice to Customer to cease the offending activity. If Customer is unable to cease such activity, Productlabs may take actions to restrict the offending activity, including, without limitation removing access to the Communication Services. Customer acknowledges that as between Customer and Productlabs, Customer is the initiator and sender of any SMS or MMS message or call transmitted through the Communications Services, whether sent or made manually or by means of an automation.
</p>

<p>
Productlabs may disable phone numbers provided to Customer in connection with the Communication Services if such numbers are substantially underused for 60 days or if Customer’s subscription to the Communication Services is otherwise suspended, terminated, or cancelled.
</p>

<p>
Some jurisdictions may require that Customer have an address within such jurisdiction or provide additional information or documentation to purchase or use a phone number within the jurisdiction. If Customer requests a phone number in such a jurisdiction, Customer agrees to provide this information as reasonably requested by Productlabs and authorizes Productlabs to disclose the provided information to appropriate third parties. Customer acknowledges that such a phone number in such a jurisdiction may be taken out of service or not provisioned if Customer does not provide the requested information.
</p>

<p>
If and to the extent that (i) Communication Services are a number-based or number-independent interpersonal communications service under the European Electronic Communications Code (as established by Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018) (the “EECC”), (ii) Customer is a micro-enterprise, small enterprise, or not-for-profit organization and (iii) Productlabs provides Customer with Communication Services within the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, Customers agrees to and does hereby waive any rights (to the extent applicable) that Customer may have under:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Article 102(1) of the EECC, which would allow Customer to receive certain pre-contractual information;</li>
    <li>Article 102(3) of the EECC, which would allow Customer to receive a contract summary;</li>
    <li>Article 102(5) of the EECC, which would allow Customer to monitor and control usage of interpersonal communications services;</li>
    <li>Article 105(1) of the EECC, which limits the maximum contract duration;</li>
    <li>Article 107(1) of the EECC, which extends other rights in the EECC to all services provided under the Agreement; and</li>
    <li>Article 107(3) of the EECC, which relates to contract extensions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Customer further agrees that:
</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>when enabling the Communications Services, Customer is consenting, on behalf of Customer and its Users and End Users to the processing of Customer Data (as generated by or necessary for the provision or operation of the Communications Services) by a third-party service provider;</li>
    <li>use of Communications Services is subject to the payment of additional Fees as detailed on the website;</li>
    <li>unless Customer chooses to turn off the recording feature, all calls made using the Voice Services are recorded. Customer is responsible for obtaining consent from its Users and End Users for any voice recordings made using the Voice Services;</li>
    <li>the Communications Services are not intended to be used for emergency texts or calls to any emergency services that are designed to be routed based upon the location of the origination of the communication or to supply the receiving party with such location information (including, but not limited to, 911 in North America, 112 in Europe, and 999 and 110 and other emergency calling codes where used) (“Emergency Communications”); and</li>
    <li>upon Customer’s access to the Communications Services being suspended or terminated, the phone numbers will also be disabled.</li>
</ol>

<p>
**Port-out:** In the event that Customer wishes to port-out its phone number(s) upon termination of its subscription to the Voice Services Customer agrees to notify support@Productlabs.us to request assistance in the port-out to the third-party service provider of Customer’s choice.
</p>

<p>
The Communications Services require terminal equipment, electrical power, and Internet access to work. Customer is solely responsible for providing these necessary elements and arranging for any desired back-up power and access options.
</p>

<h2>Limitations on and of Use of Services for Emergency Communications</h2>

<p>
Customer expressly agrees that: (i) the Communications Services are not intended to be used for Emergency Communications; (ii) Customer has arranged for other effective and reliable methods for Emergency Communications to be available at all times to any persons who may have occasion to use the Communications Services; and (iii) Customer has trained all such users and posted conspicuous reminder notices that would be seen by all such potential users that alternatives to the Communications Services should be used for Emergency Communications and that any such use is subject to the potential limitations described in the paragraph below.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Communications Services are used to try to call or text 911 or another Emergency Communications center, a communication may be initiated but these communications may differ from 911/E911 or other Emergency Communications functions furnished by traditional telephone service providers in at least the following ways: (1) Customer’s failure to provide correct registered location information or a user’s relocation of the equipment used to access the Service could result in a failure to complete or non-optimal routing of the emergency call to an incorrect emergency authority or public safety answering point, or a misunderstanding by the emergency authority of the user’s actual location; and (2) Emergency Communications will not be available if the Communications Service is unavailable for any reason, such as a lack of Internet access or electrical power.
</p>

<h2>Session Replay</h2>

<p>
If Customer uses the session replay feature, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is Customer’s responsibility to obtain the necessary consents and authorizations required under applicable law in connection with the use of this feature. Learn more about Session Replay.
</p>

<h2>Messaging Integrations</h2>

<p>
Certain Services contain integrations with third-party messaging platforms (such integrations, the “Messaging Integrations,” and such third-party messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, Twitter, and Apple Business Chat, the “Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms”). Customer hereby acknowledges that the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms are Third-Party Services as defined in the Agreement and agrees to comply with the terms of service that such Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms use to govern the use of their platform(s) (the “Non-Productlabs Messaging Platform Terms”).
</p>

<p>
Productlabs may make Messaging Integrations to other Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms available as described in the Documentation, and Customer shall comply with all applicable Non-Productlabs Messaging Platform Terms.
</p>

<p>
Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) Productlabs does not operate the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms and does not guarantee the continued availability or performance of the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms or the continued interoperability of the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms with the Services and (ii) data transmitted via Messaging Integrations is Usage Data.
</p>

<p>
Customer represents and warrants that Customer has provided notice to and received all necessary consents from End Users to contact such End Users using the Messaging Integrations and/or the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms. Customer acknowledges that (i) Customer Data and Personal Data may be transferred to and processed by the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms as necessary to provide the Services and (ii) Customer is solely responsible for configuring the interoperability of the Services with Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms to the extent any such actions are required outside of the Services.
</p>

<p>
Customer agrees not to use any Messaging Integrations that integrate with Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms to (a) facilitate direct conversations between End-Users and healthcare providers; or (b) send or collect any patient data obtained from healthcare providers. Customer acknowledges that the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms may charge Customer independently for access and use of their services or the Non-Productlabs Messaging Platforms may charge Productlabs for Customer’s use and access, in which case Productlabs may charge related fees to Customer (“Messaging Fees”).
</p>

<h3>WhatsApp Messaging:</h3>

<p>
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer’s use of Services to access WhatsApp and its related services (i) is subject to the WhatsApp Business Solution Terms and the WhatsApp Business Terms of Service and any such additional terms and conditions as may be incorporated by reference therefrom, including, without limitation, the WhatsApp Business Policy, the WhatsApp Business Data Processing Terms, the WhatsApp Intellectual Property Policy, and the WhatsApp Brand Guidelines and (ii) obligates Customer to pay Productlabs Messaging Fees as set forth in the applicable SOF or Website. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Productlabs may invoice or charge Customer monthly in arrears (or with such other timing and frequency as might be reasonably necessitated by usage-based pricing) for WhatsApp-related Messaging Fees.
</p>

<h2>AI-Powered Features</h2>

<p>
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Productlabs may utilize Customer Data submitted to the Services for the purposes of providing, maintaining, and improving the Productlabs Technology, including training artificial intelligence (“AI”) models and similar or related Services and features (“AI-Powered Features”), and Customer instructs Productlabs to process its Customer Data for such purposes, provided however, Productlabs will not share Customer Data with any other customers in connection with the foregoing. In carrying out these purposes, Productlabs may combine data collected from different contexts (for example, from Customer’s use of two separate Services) to provide Customer a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes. Customer retains all ownership of its Customer Data submitted to the Services and Productlabs retains all ownership in and to all system performance data, machine learning algorithms, and aggregated results of such machine learning. Learn more about AI-Powered Features.
</p>

<p>
Customer acknowledges that:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>certain AI-Powered Features use generative AI technology (“GAI”);</li>
    <li>output generated by GAI is probabilistic, and, as such, GAI may produce inaccurate or inappropriate content, including so-called hallucinations;</li>
    <li>due to the nature of machine learning, GAI output may not be unique across customers and the AI-Powered Features may generate the same or similar output across customers for a given input prompt;</li>
    <li>Customer should evaluate and monitor GAI outputs for accuracy and appropriateness for Customer’s specific use case;</li>
    <li>unless obvious from the context, Customer should explicitly disclose to end users interacting with AI-Powered Features that such features are non-human; and certain AI-Powered Features use third-party model providers who may monitor Customer prompts and model output (in an automated fashion or by way of human review) to detect abuse and harmful content;</li>
    <li>if this monitoring detects child sexual abuse material, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Productlabs or such third-party model provider may report the incident to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or other relevant authority.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In connection with the foregoing, in addition to complying with the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer shall not use AI-Powered Features:

    <li>to generate synthetic training data in connection with or for the purposes of training or fine tuning any artificial intelligence model;</li>
    <li>to interact with individuals under the age of consent in any way that could result in exploitation or manipulation;</li>
    <li>to make decisions that have a consequential impact on any individual’s legal position, financial position, life opportunities, employment opportunities, human rights, or that might result in physical or psychological injury to an individual, in each case without appropriate human oversight;</li>
    <li>to purposefully manipulate or effect deceptive techniques with the objective or effect of distorting the behavior of a person by impairing their ability to make an informed decision (e.g., to create or further gambling addiction);</li>
    <li>to exploit any of the vulnerabilities of a person (e.g., age, disability, or socio-economic situation);</li>
    <li>to engage in social scoring or predictive profiling that would lead to discriminatory, unfair, biased, detrimental, unfavorable, or harmful treatment of certain persons or groups of persons;</li>
    <li>to identify or verify individual identities based on people’s faces or other physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics;</li>
    <li>to develop or deploy chatbots that (i) are erotic, romantic, or used for companionship purposes, or; (ii) are personas of specific, actual people (living or dead) without their explicit consent;</li>
    <li>to infer sensitive attributes of persons such as gender, race, or specific age from images, videos, or other content of such persons;</li>
    <li>to create or promote content that (i) describes, praises, supports, promotes, glorifies, encourages and/or instructs individual(s) on self-injury or to take their own life; (ii) describes, features, or promotes graphic violence or gore; or (iii) depicts an act of terrorism; praises, or supports a terrorist organization, terrorist actor, or violent terrorist ideology; encourages terrorist activities; offers aid to terrorist organizations or terrorist causes; or aids in recruitment to a terrorist organization;</li>
    <li>in such a way as to evade or disrupt restrictions or safety filters on inputs or outputs;</li>
    <li>in a high-risk use case that could result in the death or serious bodily injury of any person or in physical or environmental damage;</li>
    <li>in connection with a medical device or to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment;</li>
    <li>to generate sexually explicit content, including content created for the purposes of pornography or sexual gratification (e.g., sexual chatbots);</li>
    <li>to facilitate spyware, communications surveillance, or unauthorized monitoring of individuals;</li>
    <li>to promote or facilitate real money gambling or payday lending;</li>
    <li>to engage in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics;</li>
    <li>to generate or promote disinformation, misinformation, or false online engagement (e.g., AI-generated comments, reviews);</li>
    <li>to engage in or promote plagiarism or other academic dishonesty;</li>
    <li>to solicit or collect sensitive identifiers, security information, or their equivalents including, without limitation, payment card information (e.g., credit card numbers or bank account information), government identifiers (e.g., SSNs), API keys, or passwords;</li>
    <li>to deter people from participation in democratic processes, including misrepresenting voting processes or qualifications and discouraging voting;</li>
    <li>to in any way facilitate the sexualization of minors, including, without limitation, minor grooming, generating content designed to impersonate a minor, depicting child abuse in any form, including instructions for how to conceal such abuse, or to promote or depicting pedophilic relationships, including via roleplay, with the GAI;</li>
    <li>to shame, humiliate, intimidate, bully, harass, or celebrate the suffering of individuals;</li>
    <li>in connection with any official local, state, or national law enforcement application except for (i) back office uses including internal training, call center support, document summarization, and accounting; or (ii) analysis of data for the location of missing persons, including in human trafficking cases, and other related applications, provided that such applications do not otherwise violate or impair the liberty, civil liberties, or human rights of natural persons; or</li>
    <li>to engage in or facilitate multi-level marketing, pyramid schemes, or other deceptive business models that use high-pressure sales tactics or exploit participants.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Customer acknowledges that certain AI-Powered Features can be trained or fine-tuned for a given Customer-defined use case using Customer-provided content (e.g., PDF files, web pages). Customer represents, warrants, and covenants that (i) Customer has and will have sufficient rights in and to any content used by Customer as a source for training or fine-tuning any AI-Powered Feature within or for Customer’s instance of a Service; (ii) and the processing of such Customer Data by Productlabs in accordance with this Agreement will not violate any laws or the rights of any third party.
</p>

<h3>Opt-out:</h3>

<p>
Customer may request that Customer Data be excluded from AI-related discriminative model training by submitting such a request to support@Productlabs.us; Customer acknowledges that by opting out of AI-related model training a number of AI-related features within Customer’s instance of the Service will no longer function. In addition to request an opt-out from AI-related discriminative model training, Customer may also disable certain AI-related features within the Services by following the relevant instructions in the Documentation (e.g., by using designated toggles in the admin control panel).
</p>

<h2>PCI-DSS Compliance</h2>

<p>
Customer is responsible for ensuring that its use of a Service to store or process credit card data complies with applicable Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”) requirements and shall not store credit card data in a Service except in the designated, encrypted fields designed for such data, as set forth in the Documentation (“Special Fields”).
